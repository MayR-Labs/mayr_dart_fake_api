## 1.1.0

- 🎉 **Breaking Change**: Converted from Flutter package to pure Dart package
- ✨ Now supports both Flutter and pure Dart applications
- 🔧 Added `AssetLoader` abstraction for flexible asset loading
- 📦 Added `FileAssetLoader` for pure Dart applications (file system based)
- 📦 Added `FlutterAssetLoader` for Flutter applications (uses rootBundle)
- 🏢 Package now owned by MayR Labs organization
- 📝 Updated all repository URLs to MayR-Labs/mayr_dart_fake_api
- 📄 Updated LICENSE to MayR Labs (https://mayrlabs.com)
- 📚 Updated documentation to reflect Dart package usage
- 🎯 Flutter is now an optional dependency (only needed for FlutterAssetLoader)

### Migration Guide

For Flutter apps, update your initialization to explicitly use FlutterAssetLoader:

```dart
import 'package:mayr_fake_api/mayr_fake_api.dart';

await MayrFakeApi.init(
  basePath: 'assets/api',
  attachTo: dio,
  assetLoader: FlutterAssetLoader(), // Add this line
);
```

For pure Dart apps, the default FileAssetLoader works automatically:

```dart
await MayrFakeApi.init(
  basePath: 'path/to/api/files',
  attachTo: dio,
  // FileAssetLoader is used by default
);
```
